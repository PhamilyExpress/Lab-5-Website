&lt;b&gt;Not only is it terrible, it's terrible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.
&lt;br&gt;He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.&lt;br&gt;
He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.&lt;br&gt;
He made it out, but a single person died.&lt;br&gt;
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.&lt;br&gt;
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.&lt;br&gt;
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.&lt;br&gt;
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.&lt;br&gt;
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.&lt;br&gt;
The man was perfectly fine.&lt;br&gt;
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.&lt;br&gt;
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.&lt;br&gt;
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.&lt;br&gt;
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.&lt;br&gt;
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.&lt;br&gt;
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.&lt;br&gt;
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.&lt;br&gt;
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.&lt;br&gt;
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.&lt;br&gt;
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executioner was speechless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man looked at the executioner and said "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jokes?"></category></entry></feed>
