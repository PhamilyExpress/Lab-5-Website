<b>Not only is it terrible, it's terrible.</b><br><br>



There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.
<br>He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.<br>
He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.<br>
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.<br>
He made it out, but a single person died.<br>
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.<br>
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.<br>
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.<br>
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.<br>
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.<br>
The man was perfectly fine.<br>
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.<br>
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.<br>
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.<br>
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.<br>
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.<br>
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.<br>
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.<br>
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.<br>
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.<br>
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.<br>

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.<br>

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.<br>

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.<br>

"You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.<br>

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.<br>

The executioner was speechless.<br>

The man looked at the executioner and said "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."
